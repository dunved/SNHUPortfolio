CS 255:
The DriverPass project aimed to create a comprehensive system for a driving test preparation service provider. The client required functionality for user registration, lesson scheduling, learning material access, and student-instructor communication. My responsibility involved designing an intuitive system that met these requirements through detailed documentation and visual representations, including various types of UML diagrams. A notable success in the project was effectively conveying complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. However, if given the opportunity to revise, I would enhance the class diagram by improving the implementation of inheritance and interfaces to better align with object-oriented design principles. Throughout the development process, I focused on transforming client requirements into practical features, such as lesson reminders and flexible scheduling options. Prioritizing user needs was crucial to ensure the system's usability and effectiveness in addressing real-world challenges. For future projects, I intend to continue employing techniques like user journey mapping, iterative feedback loops, and domain-driven design to create systems that closely align with both business objectives and user expectations.

Throughout my journey in software testing and quality assurance, I've gained valuable insights into ensuring code functionality and security. By implementing automated test suites, unit testing, and security testing practices, I've learned to catch errors early in the development process. My experience with the Contact Service project has shown me the importance of understanding user needs and translating them into clear requirements and test cases that reflect real-world scenarios. This experience has significantly impacted my approach to software design. I now prioritize testability from the outset, creating modular components that can be easily isolated and tested. I also focus on implementing input validation and boundary testing to enhance security. By combining automated testing with manual code reviews and following secure coding practices, I've developed a multi-layered verification process that identifies vulnerabilities before they reach production.The portfolio artifacts from this module highlight how testing and quality assurance are essential components of the entire software development lifecycle. These practices have not only influenced how I test code but also how I design and implement solutions that are reliable, maintainable, and aligned with user expectations. This comprehensive approach ensures that the software I develop meets both functional requirements and security standards.

CS 330: During my 3D scene project, I gained valuable insights into software design through meticulous planning, modular construction, and continuous improvement. I applied principles of lighting, object modeling, and camera positioning to craft a lifelike and engaging environment, which enhanced my grasp of computer graphics. Each stage of the project improved my design approach as I fine-tuned textures, materials, and scene composition to strike a balance between visual appeal and performance. The iterative process was crucialâ€”I repeatedly tested and adjusted shaders, object placement, and perspective to gradually shape my project into its final form. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of how computer graphics merge programming with creativity, equipping me with new technical and problem-solving abilities that I can utilize in future academic and professional endeavors involving 3D visualization and simulation work.

CS 340: During this course, I gained valuable skills in creating software that's easy to maintain, read, and adapt. I developed a Python module with CRUD functionality and connected it to a MongoDB database, which powers a data dashboard. The process of linking the dashboard to the database highlighted the importance of well-structured code, clear function names, and modular design. I tackled each challenge with a computer scientist's mindset, carefully considering data requirements, optimizing database collections, and using logical reasoning to ensure the system was reliable and scalable. This project enhanced my ability to convert client needs, such as those of Grazioso Salvare, into effective database solutions that enhance data management and accessibility. The experience significantly improved my understanding of how computer scientists design systems that enable organizations to make more informed, data-driven decisions.
